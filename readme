# README

- This project contains four source files: 
    - main.cpp
    - test.cpp
    - toy_robot.cpp 
    - toy_robot.h
- Two executables are produced from these files: 
    - main.out 
    - test.out
- Before running the executables, user must type "make all" command to build the project

## Running the executables

- To run the `main.out` executable:
    - Make sure there is an input.txt file in the same directory
    - The main.out program will read the input from the input.txt file
    - To add your own test cases, you can add them to the input.txt file
    - Navigate to the directory where it is located and type "./main.out" on the command line

- To run the `test.out` executable:
    - Make sure the google test framework is installed
    - test.out performs unit tests based on the google test framework
    - Navigate to the directory where it is located and type "./test.out" on the command line
